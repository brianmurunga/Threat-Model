# üîê Threat Mitigations for M-Pesa-Like Web App

This document outlines professional mitigation strategies for each identified threat in the threat model, along with mappings to standard security frameworks like OWASP ASVS and NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## üß® Threat: Potential Data Repudiation by Service App
- **Category**: Repudiation
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement secure, immutable audit logging (e.g., append-only logs).
  - Use digital signatures for critical actions to ensure non-repudiation.
  - Maintain logs in a centralized, tamper-evident storage solution.
  - Provide user-facing audit trails (e.g., last login, transactions).
- **OWASP ASVS**:
  - V10: Logging and Monitoring (V10.2, V10.3)
- **NIST CSF**:
  - PR.PT-1: Audit/log records are determined, documented, implemented, and reviewed.

## üß® Threat: Process Crash or Stop for Service App
- **Category**: Denial of Service
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Validate all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.
  - Implement rate limiting and throttling on endpoints.
  - Apply circuit breaker design pattern to critical services.
  - Use service supervision (e.g., systemd, Kubernetes health checks).
- **OWASP ASVS**:
  - V1: Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling (V1.14)
- **NIST CSF**:
  - PR.IP-10: Response and recovery plans are tested.
  - DE.CM-4: Malicious code is detected.

## üß® Threat: Data Flow HTTPS Is Potentially Interrupted
- **Category**: Denial of Service
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Enforce HTTPS with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).
  - Use strong TLS configurations and disable weak ciphers.
  - Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for critical internal APIs.
  - Monitor TLS certificate status and renew automatically.
- **OWASP ASVS**:
  - V9: Communications Security (V9.1, V9.2)
- **NIST CSF**:
  - PR.DS-2: Data-in-transit is protected.

## üß® Threat: Elevation Using Impersonation
- **Category**: Elevation of Privilege
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege.
  - Use signed and time-limited session tokens (e.g., JWT with scopes).
  - Validate session tokens on backend for every sensitive action.
  - Implement session inactivity timeouts and refresh mechanisms.
- **OWASP ASVS**:
  - V4: Access Control (V4.1-V4.3, V4.10)
- **NIST CSF**:
  - PR.AC-4: Access permissions are managed, incorporating least privilege.

---

## üß® Threat: Remote Execution via Elevated Privilege
- **Category**: Elevation of Privilege
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Run services with non-root users and minimal OS permissions.
  - Use containerized environments and enforce seccomp/apparmor profiles.
  - Periodically scan for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
  - Review IAM permissions and privilege boundaries.
- **OWASP ASVS**:
  - V1.5: Architecture: Secure Deployment (V1.6, V1.8)
- **NIST CSF**:
  - PR.IP-3: Configuration change control processes are in place.

---

## üìò Additional Recommendations
- **Security Testing**: Automate SAST/DAST scans and integrate into CI/CD.
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Use centralized logging, SIEM, and anomaly detection.
- **Policy Compliance**: Define and enforce security baselines for all environments.
