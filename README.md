# 🛡️ Transaction Web App Threat Model

This project is a **simulated threat model** of a basic web application inspired by M-Pesa. It is built using the [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT)](https://aka.ms/tmt).

## 🧩 Components Modeled

- **Web Client** — Login & initiate transactions
- **Web Server** — Business logic and API gateway
- **Authentication Server** — Identity & session management
- **Database** — Secure storage for users and transactions
- **External M-Pesa API** — Simulated mobile money interface
