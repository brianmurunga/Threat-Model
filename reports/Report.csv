2,Potential Process Crash or Stop for Service App,Denial Of Service,Diagram 1,HTTPS,High,Not Started,,"Service App crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric.",,Generated
3,Data Flow HTTPS Is Potentially Interrupted,Denial Of Service,Diagram 1,HTTPS,High,Not Started,,An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.,,Generated
4,Elevation Using Impersonation,Elevation Of Privilege,Diagram 1,HTTPS,High,Not Started,,Service App may be able to impersonate the context of Customer in order to gain additional privilege.,,Generated
5,Service App May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution,Elevation Of Privilege,Diagram 1,HTTPS,High,Not Started,,Customer may be able to remotely execute code for Service App.,,Generated
6,Elevation by Changing the Execution Flow in Service App,Elevation Of Privilege,Diagram 1,HTTPS,High,Not Started,,An attacker may pass data into Service App in order to change the flow of program execution within Service App to the attacker's choosing.,,Generated
8,Spoofing of the Customer External Destination Entity,Spoofing,Diagram 1,HTTPS,High,Not Started,,Customer may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being sent to the attacker's target instead of Customer. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the external entity.,,Generated

Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.",,Generated
